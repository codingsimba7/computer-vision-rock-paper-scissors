# Computer Vision RPS
Leveraging Teachable Machine, I have trained and developed a model, with 4 different classes. 
3 classes represent the three options of Rock, Paper, Scissors, and the fourth class represents none of them.
An average of 22 images were used to train each class. Teachable Machine allows us to test the accuracy of the
model live on their website, and I have noticed that there is a slight innacuracy in the model, nonetheless,
I am going to continue with the development of the code with the model as is out of curiousty. At the end if I realize 
this is being an issue I will upload more photos to the model and update it. 

The model was exported using keras and added to the folder containing the code/repository.
